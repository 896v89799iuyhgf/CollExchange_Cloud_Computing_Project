CollExchange is an iOS application that build a used-item exchange platform for college students. It uses Amazon AWS services 
such as AWS SES, AWS DynamoDB, AWS S3 and AWS Cognito Identity. The AWS iOS skk is the main framework we used in the application.

To use this application, you first need to sign an AWS account and initialize an AWS Cognito connection. Then type the Cognito
information into the Constants.m. You also need to replace the places where display "#" in the code by your own service account 
name. After finishing all the changes, you can open the project in the Xcode by click the CollExchange.xcworkspace and run it in
the simulator.

Here is the youtube link that demonstrates how to use our CollExchange application:
